# RSA2048
RSA2048
Public key encryption, private key decryption;Private key encryption, public key decryption.
Implement RSA algorithm based on C language, support public key encrypted, decrypted, private key encrypted, decrypted.
among them:
  Test1 is mainly used to encrypt and decrypt the input values in keys.h files with known public keys and secret keys;
  Test2 is mainly used to decrypt the following hex_arry array in the keys.h file;
  Test3 is mainly used to generate encrypted and decrypted files to decrypt hex_arry in keys.h.
